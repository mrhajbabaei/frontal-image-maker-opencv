# Frontal image maker with OpenCV and Deep Learning

This project makes your profile images frontal based on your landmarks' position. To detect landmarks[MTCNN network](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn) is used in this project, and you should install Tensorflow framework and Keras to be able to use it. To work with image processing parts in this project you should install OpenCV library as well, so consider installing it through CMake and build on you machine.
